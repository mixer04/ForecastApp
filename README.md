**README for Weather Forecast App**

Welcome to the Weather Forecast App! This Python script allows you to check the current weather conditions for any city using the OpenWeatherMap API.

To use this app, follow these steps:

1. Sign up for an API key from OpenWeatherMap: https://openweathermap.org/appid
2. Create a new text file named `api_key.txt` in the same directory as your Python script.
3. Paste your API key into the `api_key.txt` file.
4. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
5. Run the Python script using the command `python weather_forecast_app.py`.

Here's a brief overview of the features and usage of the app:

- The app will display a welcome message and prompt you to enter a city name.
- It will then validate the city name and make a request to the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the current weather data.
- If the city is found, the app will display the weather information based on the selected display mode:
  - Simple forecast: Displays the temperature, weather description, and wind speed.
  - Detailed forecast: Displays additional information such as feels like temperature, humidity, pressure, visibility, and cloud coverage.
- If the city is not found, the app will display an error message and prompt you to try again.

Please note that this app requires an active internet connection to fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
